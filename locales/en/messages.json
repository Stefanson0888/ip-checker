  "faq_what_exactly_ip": "What exactly is an IP address?",
  "faq_what_exactly_ip_answer": "An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to the internet. It consists of four numbers separated by dots (IPv4) like 192.168.1.1, or a longer format for IPv6. Your IP address allows other computers to find and communicate with your device.",
  
  "faq_can_change_ip": "Can I change my IP address?", 
  "faq_can_change_ip_answer": "Yes, you can change your IP address in several ways: restart your router (for dynamic IPs), use a VPN service, connect through a proxy server, or contact your ISP for a static IP change. VPNs are the most popular method for temporary IP changes.",
  
  "faq_ip_private": "Is my IP address private information?",
  "faq_ip_private_answer": "Your IP address is semi-public information. Websites you visit can see it, and it reveals your approximate location and ISP. However, it doesn't directly reveal your personal identity, home address, or browsing history without additional investigation.",
  
  "faq_why_ip_changes": "Why does my IP address change sometimes?",
  "faq_why_ip_changes_answer": "Most home internet connections use dynamic IP addresses, which your ISP can change periodically. This happens when you restart your router, after power outages, or based on your ISP's policies. Business connections often have static (unchanging) IP addresses.",
  
  "faq_how_accurate_geolocation": "How accurate is IP geolocation?",
  "faq_how_accurate_geolocation_answer": "IP geolocation is generally accurate for country and region detection (95%+ accuracy), moderately accurate for cities (60-80% accuracy), but not precise enough for exact addresses. The accuracy depends on your ISP's infrastructure and database quality.",

  "ip_address_explanation": "An IP (Internet Protocol) address is your device's unique identifier on the internet. Think of it as your digital postal address that allows other computers to find and communicate with your device. Every time you browse the web, check email, or use online services, your IP address tells the world where to send the data back to you.",
  
  "types_of_ip": "Types of IP Addresses",
  "ipv4_vs_ipv6": "IPv4 vs IPv6",
  "ipv4_description": "IPv4 addresses use four numbers separated by dots (like 192.168.1.1). This is the most common format you'll see, but we're running out of available IPv4 addresses.",
  "ipv6_description": "IPv6 addresses are longer and use letters and numbers (like 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334). This newer format provides virtually unlimited addresses for future internet growth.",
  
  "dynamic_vs_static": "Dynamic vs Static IP Addresses",
  "dynamic_ip_description": "Dynamic IPs change each time you connect to the internet. Most home users have dynamic IPs assigned by their internet provider.",
  "static_ip_description": "Static IPs never change and are typically used by businesses that need consistent remote access or host websites and servers.",
  
  "comprehensive_faq": "Comprehensive FAQ",
  "faq_subtitle": "Everything you need to know about IP addresses, privacy, and online security",
  
  "faq_what_can_websites_see": "What can websites see from my IP address?",
  "faq_websites_see_answer": "Websites can see your approximate location (country, region, city), your internet service provider, the type of connection you're using, and whether you're likely using a VPN or proxy. They cannot see your exact home address, personal information, or browsing history on other sites.",
  
  "faq_hide_ip_address": "How can I hide my IP address?",
  "faq_hide_ip_answer": "The most effective ways to hide your IP address are: using a VPN service (encrypts traffic and changes your apparent location), connecting through a proxy server (basic IP masking), using Tor browser (multiple layers of encryption), or connecting through public Wi-Fi (though this has security risks).",
  
  "faq_track_real_location": "Can someone track my real location from my IP?",
  "faq_track_location_answer": "IP addresses show your approximate location based on your internet provider's infrastructure, not your exact physical address. However, law enforcement or sophisticated attackers with additional information might be able to trace it back to you through your ISP.",
  
  "faq_same_ip_multiple_devices": "Do all devices in my home have the same IP address?",
  "faq_same_ip_answer": "Yes, all devices connected to the same home network share the same public IP address when communicating with the internet. Your router uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to manage traffic between your devices and the internet.",
  
  "faq_ip_address_illegal": "Is it illegal to look up someone's IP address?",
  "faq_ip_illegal_answer": "Looking up publicly available IP information is generally legal, as IP addresses are not considered private information. However, using IP addresses for stalking, harassment, or unauthorized access to systems is illegal. Always respect privacy and use IP tools ethically.",
  
  "faq_vpn_change_ip": "Will using a VPN change my IP address?",
  "faq_vpn_change_answer": "Yes, a VPN (Virtual Private Network) routes your internet traffic through VPN servers, making it appear as if you're browsing from the VPN server's location instead of your real location. This effectively changes your visible IP address.",
  
  "faq_isp_track_activity": "Can my ISP track my online activity?",
  "faq_isp_track_answer": "Yes, your Internet Service Provider can see which websites you visit, when you visit them, and how much data you transfer. They cannot see the specific content of encrypted websites (HTTPS), but they can see the domain names. Using a VPN prevents your ISP from seeing your browsing activity.",
  
  "faq_ip_address_change_location": "Does my IP address change when I travel?",
  "faq_ip_change_travel_answer": "Yes, when you connect to different networks while traveling, you'll get different IP addresses associated with those locations. Hotel Wi-Fi, mobile data in different countries, and public networks will all show different IP addresses and locations.",
  
  "faq_multiple_ip_addresses": "Can I have multiple IP addresses?",
  "faq_multiple_ip_answer": "Yes, you can have multiple IP addresses through various methods: using different internet connections (home Wi-Fi, mobile data), connecting to VPN servers in different locations, using proxy services, or having multiple internet service providers.",
  
  "faq_ip_address_expire": "Do IP addresses expire?",
  "faq_ip_expire_answer": "Dynamic IP addresses can change based on your ISP's policies - typically when you restart your router or after a certain period.

  "faq_dangerous_share_ip": "Is it dangerous to share my IP address?",
  "faq_dangerous_share_answer": "Sharing your IP address isn't immediately dangerous, but it's not recommended. Someone with your IP address could potentially launch targeted attacks, attempt to access your network if it's not properly secured, or use it for social engineering. It's better to keep this information private when possible.",
  
  "faq_school_work_track": "Can my school or workplace track my IP address?",
  "faq_school_work_track_answer": "Yes, schools and workplaces can monitor internet usage on their networks, including tracking which websites employees or students visit.
